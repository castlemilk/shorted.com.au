# Custom ESLint Rules for Component Import/Export Validation

## Issue: React Component Import/Export Mismatches

### Problems We've Encountered:

1. **Lowercase component names** - React components must start with uppercase
2. **Import name mismatches** - Importing with different casing than exported
3. **Default export mismatches** - Component exported with one name, imported with another

### Fixed Issues:

1. `companyInfo.tsx` - Component was `companyInfo`, needed to be `CompanyInfo`
2. `shorts/[stockCode]/page.tsx` - Had `"use client"` but used async server components
3. `columns.tsx` - Imported as `Sparkline` but exported as `SparkLine`

### How to Detect These Issues:

```bash
# Find lowercase default exports (potential issue)
find src -name "*.tsx" -type f | xargs grep "^export default [a-z]"

# Find component definitions with lowercase names
find src -name "*.tsx" -type f | xargs grep "^const [a-z][A-Z].*=.*FC"

# Clear Next.js cache when making these changes
rm -rf .next
```

### Best Practices:

1. **Always use PascalCase for React components**
2. **Match import names with export names**
3. **Use TypeScript to catch type mismatches**
4. **Clear .next cache after fixing naming issues**
5. **Run `npm run build` to catch issues early**
