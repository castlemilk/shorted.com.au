# Introducing Shorted

In the fast-paced world of finance, timely and transparent information is crucial. Today, we're excited to introduce **Shorted**â€”your gateway to understanding short selling activities on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).

## Understanding Short Selling

Before we delve into Shorted, let's revisit the concept of short selling:

Short selling is an investment strategy where traders anticipate a decline in a stock's price. They borrow shares to sell them on the market, intending to repurchase them later at a lower price, pocketing the difference as profit.

## The Need for Transparency

### The Challenge: Limited Access to Data

Tracking short positions on the ASX has historically been cumbersome. While the exchange provides data, it's often:

- **Delayed** in reporting
- **Complex** to interpret
- **Lacking** in historical perspective

This opacity hinders investors and analysts from making fully informed decisions.
