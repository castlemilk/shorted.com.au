# Proto Directory

This directory is a placeholder for Vercel builds. The actual protobuf definitions and generated code are already committed in:
- `/web/src/gen/` - Generated TypeScript/JavaScript code

The protobuf generation is done locally and the generated files are committed to the repository, so we don't need to generate them during the build process.
