# `shorted` — consolidated batch-job binary

One Go module, one binary, one image for every batch job/crawler/collector.
Implements **Phase 1** of `docs/jobs-consolidation-plan.md`.

```
shorted                          # list available jobs
shorted influence -mode all      # a job with its own flags
shorted reports coverage -h      # nested job group
shorted -verbose reports sync -limit 10
```

## Layout

```
services/jobs/
  cmd/shorted/main.go         root CLI: global flags → registry dispatch
  internal/runner/            Job interface, Registry, Group, signal ctx, start/end logs
  internal/platform/          db (pgxpool), revalidate ping, env config
  internal/jobs/announcements/`shorted announcements` (was services/asx-announcement-crawler)
  internal/jobs/economy/      `shorted economy`    (was services/economy-collector)
  internal/jobs/influence/    `shorted influence`  (was services/influence-collector)
  internal/jobs/news/         `shorted news`       (was services/news-aggregator)
  internal/jobs/reports/      `shorted reports coverage|link|sync`
                              (was services/report-coverage / -linker / -sync)
  internal/jobs/signals/      `shorted signals`    (was services/signals-collector, Python)
  internal/jobs/weeklyreport/ `shorted weekly-report`
                              (was services/weekly-report-generator)
  Dockerfile                  standard image (context = services/)
```

## Migration status

| Subcommand | Replaces | Deployed? |
|---|---|---|
| `announcements` | `services/asx-announcement-crawler` | yes — Cloud Run Job (still served by the OLD service) |
| `economy` | `services/economy-collector` | yes — Cloud Run Job (still served by the OLD service) |
| `influence` | `services/influence-collector` | no — laptop-only tool |
| `news` | `services/news-aggregator` | yes — Cloud Run Job (still served by the OLD service) |
| `reports coverage` | `services/report-coverage` | no — laptop-only tool |
| `reports link` | `services/report-linker` | no — laptop-only tool |
| `reports sync` | `services/report-sync` | no — laptop-only tool |
| `signals` | `services/signals-collector` (Python) | yes — Cloud Run Job (still served by the OLD service) |
| `weekly-report` | `services/weekly-report-generator` | yes — Cloud Run Job (still served by the OLD service) |

The old services are still present and still build; per the plan's invariants a
service is only deleted in a later cleanup PR, after its replacement has run
green. **Nothing deployed changes yet** — `announcements` and `economy` are code
ports only: their Terraform, images and schedules still point at the standalone
services, and the scheduler cutover is a separate PR per job.

## Phase 2b port notes (news / signals / weekly-report)

Behaviour is carried over one-for-one except where a shared-binary invariant
forced a change. The deliberate divergences:

- **`news`: `RUN_MODE` → `-run-mode`.** The env var is still the flag's DEFAULT,
  so the deployed schedulers' `container_overrides` keep working untouched; an
  explicit flag wins. Unknown modes now fail fast instead of falling through to
  the aggregate path.
- **`news`: no implicit HTTP server.** The standalone binary served `/health` +
  `POST /run` whenever `CLOUD_RUN_JOB` was unset — a leftover from its Cloud Run
  *service* days (in prod it is a Job, and Cloud Run always sets that variable,
  so the branch was unreachable there). It is preserved behind an explicit
  `-run-mode serve` (with graceful shutdown) so `shorted news` on a laptop
  aggregates and exits instead of silently becoming a server.
- **`news`: `-dry-run` is refused** for `embed-backfill`,
  `embed-company-summaries`, `digest` and `serve` — those modes write
  regardless, and the standalone binary silently ignored the flag.
- **`news`: aggregate-only collaborators are built lazily.** The stock matcher
  (a DB query), the sentiment analyzer and the stealth RSS engine are only
  constructed for `aggregate`/`serve`; the standalone binary built them before
  the RUN_MODE switch, so a `cluster-news` or `digest` run paid for them.
- **`weekly-report`: the revalidation ping goes through `platform.PingRevalidate`.**
  Same endpoint and same query (`?secret=…&tag=report-<slug>` — `Tag` was added
  to `RevalidateRequest` for it), but the shared helper adds a 45s deadline on a
  detached context and REDACTS the URL from error logs; the original logged the
  raw `*url.Error`, which contains `?secret=`.
- **`signals` is a Python→Go rewrite.** Same flags, same SQL, same
  `sha1(code|polarity|headline)` content hash, same 1s/3s 5xx backoff. It writes
  through the shared pgx pool inside a per-stock transaction instead of one
  psycopg2 connection behind a mutex, dedupes rows by content hash before the
  multi-row upsert (Postgres rejects a second hit on the same conflict target,
  which failed the whole stock in `collect.py`), and stops on SIGTERM (selection
  is `last_fetched_at`-driven, so a partial sweep resumes next run).
- **`log.Fatal*` is gone** from every ported path (including
  `NewRSSFetcher`), per the convention below.

## Conventions for new jobs

1. Add `internal/jobs/<name>/` with a `Job() runner.Job` constructor.
2. Parse flags with a `flag.FlagSet` inside `Run(ctx, args)` — never
   package-level `flag.X` vars (they'd leak across subcommands). Default
   `-dry-run`/`-verbose` from `runner.FromContext(ctx)` so the global flags work.
   If the job honours a dry run, ALSO set `DryRun: true` on its `runner.Func` —
   the runner refuses a global `-dry-run` against a job that doesn't declare it,
   rather than letting it silently write.
3. Get the DB from `platform.ConnectFromEnv` (SimpleProtocol + pooler-safe) and
   the cache bust from `platform.PingRevalidate` — do not hand-roll either.
4. Return errors; don't `log.Fatal` and never `panic` for expected failures.
   The runner logs `[job] done … status=error` and main exits non-zero, and your
   deferred cleanup actually runs. Long per-item loops must check `ctx.Err()`
   each iteration and wait on `select { case <-ctx.Done(): … }`, not
   `time.Sleep`, so SIGTERM lands promptly.
5. Register it in `cmd/shorted/main.go`.

## Building the image

Context is `services/` (the module has a `replace … => ../` for `pkg/*`):

```bash
docker build -f services/jobs/Dockerfile services
# or, with access to the private stealth module:
docker build -f services/jobs/Dockerfile --secret id=github_token,env=GH_TOKEN services
```

`pkg/enrichment` (used by `reports coverage|link`) pulls `pkg/stealthhttp` →
`github.com/skunkworq/stealth`, so the `FROM scratch AS stealth` stage from the
other service Dockerfiles carries over unchanged.

Note that **neither `go.mod` carries a stealth `replace`** — local builds get it
from `services/go.work`, the bind-mount branch of the Dockerfile adds one
pointing at `/stealth`, and the GitHub-token branch needs none (a committed
`replace … => ../../../stealth` resolves to a non-existent `/stealth` in the
image and breaks the token path before the token is read).

### Phase 2b review notes (documented divergences)

- **news**: the old binary set `log.SetOutput(os.Stdout)`; the monolith logs to
  stderr like every other job. If any log-based metric filters on the stdout
  stream for news-aggregator, update it at cutover.
- **signals**: brandbrain responses are decoded strictly (typed floats/strings);
  Python coerced loosely. Upstream schema drift (e.g. confidence as a JSON
  string) fails the decode — surfaced as a retried, then logged+counted error.
