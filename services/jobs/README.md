# `shorted` — consolidated batch-job binary

One Go module, one binary, one image for every batch job/crawler/collector.
Implements **Phase 1** of `docs/jobs-consolidation-plan.md`.

```
shorted                          # list available jobs
shorted influence -mode all      # a job with its own flags
shorted reports coverage -h      # nested job group
shorted -verbose reports sync -limit 10
shorted market-data serve        # a long-running HTTP surface, not a batch run
```

## Migration status

| Subcommand | Replaces | Deployed? |
|---|---|---|
| `announcements` | `services/asx-announcement-crawler` | yes — `shorted-announcements` (cutover 1; old scheduler paused) |
| `discovery` | `services/asx-discovery` | **not yet** — ported (Phase 2c), no Terraform change; needs the browser image |
| `economy` | `services/economy-collector` | yes — `shorted-economy` (cutover 1; old scheduler paused) |
| `influence` | `services/influence-collector` | no — laptop-only tool |
| `market-data serve` | `services/market-data-sync` (default mode) | **not yet** — ported (Phase 2c), no Terraform change |
| `market-data sync` | `services/market-data-sync -cli` | **not yet** — ported (Phase 2c) |
| `market-data audit-gaps` | `services/market-data-sync/cmd/audit-gaps` | no — laptop-only tool |
| `market-data historical-backfill` | `services/market-data-sync/cmd/historical-backfill` | no — laptop-only tool |
| `news` | `services/news-aggregator` | yes — `shorted-news`, 1 job + 5 schedules (cutover 2; all 5 old schedulers paused) |
| `reports coverage` | `services/report-coverage` | no — laptop-only tool |
| `reports link` | `services/report-linker` | no — laptop-only tool |
| `reports sync` | `services/report-sync` | no — laptop-only tool |
| `signals` | `services/signals-collector` (Python) | yes — `shorted-signals` (cutover 2; old scheduler paused) |
| `weekly-report` | `services/weekly-report-generator` | yes — `shorted-weekly-report`, weekly + monthly schedules (cutover 2; old schedulers paused) |

The old services are still present, still build and stay **deployed + manually
executable**; per the plan's invariants a service is only deleted in a later
cleanup PR, after its replacement has run green for ≥1 scheduled cycle. Only the
old *schedulers* are paused, so rollback is a `scheduler_paused` / `paused`
variable flip in `terraform/environments/{dev,prod}/main.tf` — see
`docs/jobs-consolidation-plan.md` ("Cutover slice 1" / "Cutover slice 2").

## Phase 2b port notes (news / signals / weekly-report)

Behaviour is carried over one-for-one except where a shared-binary invariant
forced a change. The deliberate divergences:

- **`news`: `RUN_MODE` → `-run-mode`.** The env var is still the flag's DEFAULT,
  so the deployed schedulers' `container_overrides` keep working untouched; an
  explicit flag wins. Unknown modes now fail fast instead of falling through to
  the aggregate path.
- **`news`: no implicit HTTP server.** The standalone binary served `/health` +
  `POST /run` whenever `CLOUD_RUN_JOB` was unset — a leftover from its Cloud Run
  *service* days (in prod it is a Job, and Cloud Run always sets that variable,
  so the branch was unreachable there). It is preserved behind an explicit
  `-run-mode serve` (with graceful shutdown) so `shorted news` on a laptop
  aggregates and exits instead of silently becoming a server.
- **`news`: `-dry-run` is refused** for `embed-backfill`,
  `embed-company-summaries`, `digest` and `serve` — those modes write
  regardless, and the standalone binary silently ignored the flag.
- **`news`: aggregate-only collaborators are built lazily.** The stock matcher
  (a DB query), the sentiment analyzer and the stealth RSS engine are only
  constructed for `aggregate`/`serve`; the standalone binary built them before
  the RUN_MODE switch, so a `cluster-news` or `digest` run paid for them.
- **`weekly-report`: the revalidation ping goes through `platform.PingRevalidate`.**
  Same endpoint and same query (`?secret=…&tag=report-<slug>` — `Tag` was added
  to `RevalidateRequest` for it), but the shared helper adds a 45s deadline on a
  detached context and REDACTS the URL from error logs; the original logged the
  raw `*url.Error`, which contains `?secret=`.
- **`signals` is a Python→Go rewrite.** Same flags, same SQL, same
  `sha1(code|polarity|headline)` content hash, same 1s/3s 5xx backoff. It writes
  through the shared pgx pool inside a per-stock transaction instead of one
  psycopg2 connection behind a mutex, dedupes rows by content hash before the
  multi-row upsert (Postgres rejects a second hit on the same conflict target,
  which failed the whole stock in `collect.py`), and stops on SIGTERM (selection
  is `last_fetched_at`-driven, so a partial sweep resumes next run).
- **`log.Fatal*` is gone** from every ported path (including
  `NewRSSFetcher`), per the convention below.

## Phase 2c port notes (market-data / discovery)

Both source services live in their OWN Go modules (`services/market-data-sync`,
`services/asx-discovery`, both members of `services/go.work`). Those modules are
untouched and still build; this slice is CODE ONLY — no Terraform, no schedule
change, no deletion.

### `market-data` — a service, not a job

`market-data-sync` is the only source service that is a Cloud Run **service**
(a weekday scheduler POSTs its endpoints), so the HTTP surface is preserved
verbatim behind `serve` — exactly the way `news` kept its serve mode.

| Old invocation | New |
|---|---|
| `market-data-sync` (default) | `shorted market-data serve` |
| `market-data-sync -cli` | `shorted market-data sync` |
| `cmd/audit-gaps -minGapDays -years -details` | `shorted market-data audit-gaps` (same flags) |
| `cmd/historical-backfill -years -limit -priority-only -force -symbol` | `shorted market-data historical-backfill` (same flags) |

Endpoints, paths, request/response shapes, CORS and readiness semantics are
unchanged: `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/health`, `POST /api/sync/stock/{symbol}`,
`POST /api/sync/all`, `GET /api/sync/status[/{runId}]`,
`GET /api/gaps/detect/{symbol}`, `POST /api/gaps/repair/{symbol}`,
`GET /api/gaps/report/{symbol}`, `GET /api/gaps/detect-all`. Environment is
unchanged (`DATABASE_URL`, `DB_MAX_CONNS`/`DB_MIN_CONNS`, `GCS_BUCKET_NAME`,
`PRIORITY_STOCK_COUNT`, `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`, `ALGOLIA_*`, `SYNC_ALGOLIA`,
`PORT`, `LOCAL_ASX_CSV`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`).
`serve` also gained a `-port` flag that overrides `$PORT`; unset, behaviour is
identical.

`sync/stock_price_coverage.go` is carried over byte-for-byte, so the
`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_stock_price_coverage` that runs after
a sweep with `pricesUpdated > 0` — plus both `mv_stock_price_coverage` →
`stock_prices` query fallbacks — behave exactly as before.

**No `-dry-run`.** The source service has no dry-run concept in any mode, so no
subcommand declares `DryRun`, and a global `shorted -dry-run market-data …` is
refused before anything opens a pool (asserted in `job_test.go`).

**DB pool does NOT go through `platform`.** `platform.Connect` only exposes
`MaxConns`; market-data needs `MinConns`, `MaxConnLifetime`, `MaxConnIdleTime`,
`HealthCheckPeriod` and `ConnConfig.ConnectTimeout` for its multi-hour sweeps,
plus operator-tunable `DB_MAX_CONNS`/`DB_MIN_CONNS`. `buildDBPoolConfig` is
preserved verbatim (including `QueryExecModeSimpleProtocol`) and its two unit
tests came across with it. `audit-gaps` is the one place this *tightens*
behaviour: the standalone `cmd/audit-gaps` used a bare `pgxpool.New` (extended
protocol, default pool size) against the same Supabase pooler, and now shares the
tuned config.

### `discovery` — env-only, browser image

No flags, before or after: `GCS_BUCKET_NAME` (default `shorted-data`) and
`DOWNLOAD_DIR` (default `/tmp/asx-downloads`). The one addition is a `FlagSet`
whose only job is to make `-h` print that contract and to **reject stray
arguments** — the standalone binary ignored `os.Args` entirely, so a typo'd
invocation still ran a full scrape and upload. Like market-data it declares no
dry-run, so a global `-dry-run` is refused rather than silently uploading.

### Deliberate divergences

| Area | Standalone | Here | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `log.Fatalf` (13 sites across both) | exits immediately | returns an error, texts preserved | deferred pool/GCS/OTel closes actually run; the runner logs `status=error` and main exits 1 |
| `api.Server` listener failure | `log.Fatalf` inside the listener goroutine | buffered `serveErr` chan → `AwaitShutdown` / `Err()` | a bind failure skipped every deferred close **and** the OTel flush |
| serve dependency-init retry | `time.Sleep(backoff)`, `log.Fatalf` on cancel/exhaustion | ctx-aware `select`, errors returned; abandons early if the listener already failed | SIGTERM during a 30s backoff now lands promptly |
| `sync` interrupted | `os.Exit(130)` | returns `sync interrupted: …` → exit 1 | the shared binary has one failure exit code; 130 is no longer distinguishable |
| `historical-backfill` interrupted | `return` → **exit 0** | returns a cancellation error → exit 1 | an interrupted backfill used to look like a clean run to any caller |
| `audit-gaps` gaps found | `os.Exit(1)` after printing | sentinel error → exit 1, same report | same exit code, but deferred cleanup runs |
| `audit-gaps` on an empty DB | divided by `len(stocks)` → `NaN%` | reports "no stocks to audit" and returns | guard, not a behaviour anyone relied on |
| `audit-gaps` stock-list scan | never checked `rows.Err()` | checked | a mid-iteration drop silently produced a SHORT list and a clean audit |
| `historical-backfill` gap query | `defer rows.Close()` **inside the per-stock loop** | closed per call | rows (and their pooled connections) stayed open for the whole multi-thousand-stock run |
| `historical-backfill` gap threshold | literal `4` inlined in SQL | `$2` parameter (`backfillMinGapDays`) | same value, parameterised |
| HTTP JSON responses | `json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(...)`, error dropped ×18 | `writeJSON` helper, encode failures logged | one call site to audit |
| `http.Server` | no `ReadHeaderTimeout` | 10s | unbounded header read is a slow-loris vector |
| scraper "settle" wait | `time.Sleep(3s)` | `select` on `ctx.Done()` | SIGTERM lands promptly |
| scraper `DownloadDirect` | `defer out.Close()` (error dropped) | `Close` checked | a failed final flush is exactly how a truncated CSV reaches GCS |
| discovery download-dir cleanup | `defer os.RemoveAll` registered only **after** a successful download | registered as soon as the dir may exist | a failed scrape left the scratch dir behind |
| `POST /api/sync/all` background goroutine | `context.Background()` | **unchanged** | deliberately outlives both the request and the shutdown drain; the sweep is checkpointed/resumable. Documented at the call site rather than "fixed". |
| OTel identity | service `shorted-market-data-sync`, metric attr `market-data-sync`; `asx-discovery` | unchanged | dashboard continuity — the two market-data identities differed in the original and are carried over as-is |

### Not ported

- **`cmd/test-dmp-fetch`, `cmd/test-dmp-backfill`** — single-stock ("DMP")
  scratch probes with a hard-coded symbol; scratch tooling, not a job.
- **`cmd/fetch-single-stock`** — subsumed by
  `shorted market-data historical-backfill -symbol <CODE> -force -years N`,
  which does the same force-fetch-and-upsert over the same provider chain.
  (It is **not** the same as `POST /api/sync/stock/{symbol}`, which is
  incremental + gap-repair, not a forced full-history refetch.)
- **`market-data-sync/otel.go`** — a second, unreferenced OTel bootstrap
  (`initOTEL`) that nothing in that module ever called; `pkg/otel.InitProvider`
  is the live path and is what the port uses.
- **`//go:build integration` tests** in both modules (they need
  `testcontainers-go`, which this module does not depend on). All three
  scratch CLIs and the integration tests remain runnable from the old modules
  until the deletion PR.

### Dependency versions

New direct requirements in `jobs/go.mod`, and how they compare to the source
modules:

| Module | Source module pins | jobs pins | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `github.com/google/uuid` | `v1.6.0` | `v1.6.0` | same (was already an indirect here) |
| `github.com/piquette/finance-go` | `v1.1.0` | `v1.1.0` | same — see the caveat below |
| `github.com/mxschmitt/playwright-go` | — (see below) | `v0.6100.0` | same version the scraper compiles against today |
| `cloud.google.com/go/storage` | `v1.58.0` | **`v1.64.0`** | **forced upward** — the jobs module already pinned 1.64 for other jobs |
| `google.golang.org/api` | `v0.258.0` | **`v0.290.0`** | **forced upward**, same reason |
| `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` | `v5.8.0` | **`v5.10.0`** | **forced upward**, same reason |
| `go.opentelemetry.io/otel*` | `v1.40.0` | **`v1.44.0`** | **forced upward**, same reason |

**`finance-go` is carried for an unused provider.** `providers/yahoo.go`
(`NewYahooFinanceProvider`, the finance-go implementation) has no caller in
either module — the live chain is `NewYahooFinanceDirectProvider` plus optional
Alpha Vantage. It was ported unchanged rather than pruned, because deleting a
provider implementation is a product decision, not a mechanical port. Dropping
`providers/yahoo.go` + `yahoo_test.go` would remove `github.com/piquette/finance-go`
(and its `shopspring/decimal` transitive) from the shared module entirely —
a good follow-up, deliberately not bundled into this slice.

The four forced convergences are all *upgrades* of the source modules' pins onto
what the consolidated module already used for the eight previously-ported jobs;
downgrading the shared module to match one source service was not an option. The
old modules keep their own pins (their `go.mod`s are untouched) — but note they
were already resolving through `services/go.work`, which takes the union of the
workspace build list, so their *compiled* versions were already the higher ones.

### The playwright pin — a landmine found during the port

`services/asx-discovery/go.mod` requires
`github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go v0.5200.1`, but
`scraper/asx_scraper.go` imports **`github.com/mxschmitt/playwright-go`**, which
that module never requires. It compiles only because `services/go.work` unions
in the parent `services` module's `github.com/mxschmitt/playwright-go v0.6100.0`
— and the service's own Dockerfile does `go work init . ./asx-discovery`, so the
deployed image resolves the same way. The declared dependency is dead.

That makes the old image's Chromium pin wrong in two independent ways:

- `asx-discovery/Dockerfile` installs `playwright@1.57.0`, citing "playwright-go
  v0.5200.1 (driver 1.57.0)". v0.5200.1's `playwrightCliVersion` is **1.52.0**.
- The driver actually linked is v0.6100.0's, i.e. **1.61.1**.

So the pre-bundled Chromium has never matched the driver, and `discovery` has
been re-downloading ~165 MiB of Chromium from `cdn.playwright.dev` on every run
— the exact failure that pin was added to prevent.

`Dockerfile.browser` therefore pins **`playwright@1.61.1`**, matching
`playwrightCliVersion` in the `mxschmitt/playwright-go v0.6100.0` that
`jobs/go.mod` now requires directly (no workspace accident). It deliberately
does NOT copy asx-discovery's 1.57.0. Everything else in the browser stage —
Debian base, Node install, the Chromium shared-library list, the
`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` / `ms-playwright-go` / `/tmp/asx-downloads`
directories, `DOWNLOAD_DIR` — is copied verbatim. **Keep the npm pin in lockstep
with `playwrightCliVersion` on any playwright-go bump.**

Fixing the old module's dead requirement/pin is out of scope for this
code-only slice; it disappears when `services/asx-discovery` is deleted.

### Images

`Dockerfile` (distroless/static) stays lean and serves the other eight jobs.
`Dockerfile.browser` builds the **same binary** with the same build stage and
the same `services/` context, onto a Debian base carrying Chromium — only the
runtime differs, and only `discovery` needs it:

```bash
docker build -f services/jobs/Dockerfile.browser services
docker build -f services/jobs/Dockerfile.browser --secret id=github_token,env=GH_TOKEN services
```

Both images use `ENTRYPOINT ["/shorted"]`, so a Cloud Run Job passes the
subcommand as args (`args = ["discovery"]`). If house-prices' non-CDP modes are
ever containerised they belong on the browser image too; its CDP modes drive a
host Chrome on the residential Macs and need no browser in the image at all.

## Conventions for new jobs

1. Add `internal/jobs/<name>/` with a `Job() runner.Job` constructor.
2. Parse flags with a `flag.FlagSet` inside `Run(ctx, args)` — never
   package-level `flag.X` vars (they'd leak across subcommands). Default
   `-dry-run`/`-verbose` from `runner.FromContext(ctx)` so the global flags work.
   If the job honours a dry run, ALSO set `DryRun: true` on its `runner.Func` —
   the runner refuses a global `-dry-run` against a job that doesn't declare it,
   rather than letting it silently write.
3. Get the DB from `platform.ConnectFromEnv` (SimpleProtocol + pooler-safe) and
   the cache bust from `platform.PingRevalidate` — do not hand-roll either.
4. Return errors; don't `log.Fatal` and never `panic` for expected failures.
   The runner logs `[job] done … status=error` and main exits non-zero, and your
   deferred cleanup actually runs. Long per-item loops must check `ctx.Err()`
   each iteration and wait on `select { case <-ctx.Done(): … }`, not
   `time.Sleep`, so SIGTERM lands promptly.
5. Register it in `cmd/shorted/main.go`.

## Building the image

Context is `services/` (the module has a `replace … => ../` for `pkg/*`):

```bash
docker build -f services/jobs/Dockerfile services
# or, with access to the private stealth module:
docker build -f services/jobs/Dockerfile --secret id=github_token,env=GH_TOKEN services
```

`pkg/enrichment` (used by `reports coverage|link`) pulls `pkg/stealthhttp` →
`github.com/skunkworq/stealth`, so the `FROM scratch AS stealth` stage from the
other service Dockerfiles carries over unchanged.

Note that **neither `go.mod` carries a stealth `replace`** — local builds get it
from `services/go.work`, the bind-mount branch of the Dockerfile adds one
pointing at `/stealth`, and the GitHub-token branch needs none (a committed
`replace … => ../../../stealth` resolves to a non-existent `/stealth` in the
image and breaks the token path before the token is read).

### Phase 2b review notes (documented divergences)

- **news**: the old binary set `log.SetOutput(os.Stdout)`; the monolith logs to
  stderr like every other job. If any log-based metric filters on the stdout
  stream for news-aggregator, update it at cutover.
- **signals**: brandbrain responses are decoded strictly (typed floats/strings);
  Python coerced loosely. Upstream schema drift (e.g. confidence as a JSON
  string) fails the decode — surfaced as a retried, then logged+counted error.
